My name is Anh Tung Ho. I am the senior undergraduate student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), where I pursue BS degree in Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of Professor Huitaek Yun (advisor of my graduation thesis) and Professor Hyun Jin Kim. 

I am enthusiastic about controlling robotic and automation systems. I had experience in developing flatforms for autonomous vehicles and industrial manipulators.
