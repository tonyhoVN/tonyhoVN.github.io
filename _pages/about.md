I am currently a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at [Stony Brook University, USA](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) with my advisor, [Prof. William Stewart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UdGrhc0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

Before enrolling in SBU, I graduated from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), where I pursue BS degree in Mechanical Engineering (specialize in Robotics and Control System) under the supervision of [Prof. Huitaek Yun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-1agGGkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Hyun Jin Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=msC__OwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My research focuses on controlling robotics and automation systems. I had experience in developing control flatforms for autonomous vehicles and industrial manipulators.
